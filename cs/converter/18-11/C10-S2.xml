    <questiontext format="html"><text><![CDATA[<p>Dandelion checked her bank statement with the bank account in her general ledger and found the following differences:<br>(i) Some bank payments have not cleared the bank statement.<br>(ii) The bank credited a personal lodgement to her business account in error.<br>(iii) The bank debited fees on her account.<br>Which of the differences require an entry in the bank account in the general ledger?</p>]]></text></questiontext>
    <generalfeedback format="html"><text><![CDATA[<p>The following is GenAI explanations, use with caution.The general ledger bank account is updated for items that the business was previously unaware of, which appear on the bank statement. Bank fees are an example of this.<br>(i) Uncleared bank payments are timing differences. The entry has already been made in the general ledger; it just hasn't appeared on the bank statement yet. This is a reconciling item, not a new entry.<br>(ii) A bank error (crediting a personal lodgement) is an error made by the bank. It will be noted on the bank reconciliation statement, and the bank must correct it. No entry is made in the business's general ledger.<br>(iii) Bank fees are a legitimate business expense that the business learns about from the bank statement. This requires an entry in the general ledger to record the expense and reduce the bank balance (Debit Bank Charges expense, Credit Bank). Therefore, only item (iii) requires a new entry in the general ledger.</p>]]></text></generalfeedback>

    <questiontext format="html"><text><![CDATA[<p>You are preparing a client's financial statements. You know that the client's accounts assistant has correctly completed a reconciliation of the bank balance in the general ledger to the balance on the bank statement. The balances from the general ledger and the bank statement are:<br>General ledger balance $2,358 (credit)<br>Bank statement balance $1,053 (debit)<br>The difference between the two balances is explained by uncleared payments and outstanding lodgements.<br>How should the bank balance be reported in the financial statements?</p>]]></text></questiontext>
    <generalfeedback format="html"><text><![CDATA[<p>The following is GenAI explanations, use with caution.The balance reported in the financial statements is the adjusted cash balance from the company's own records, which is the general ledger balance. The general ledger balance of $2,358 (credit) indicates a bank overdraft. A bank overdraft is a short-term loan from the bank and is classified as a current liability. The bank statement balance is the bank's record and is used for reconciliation purposes, but the general ledger figure is what appears in the statement of financial position.</p>]]></text></generalfeedback>

When he carried out his bank reconciliation, he found that he had omitted bank charges of $722 for the year to 30 April 20X8.<br>What bank balance should be included on Jim's opening trial balance at 1 May 20X8?</p>]]></text></questiontext>
    <generalfeedback format="html"><text><![CDATA[<p>The following is GenAI explanations, use with caution.The opening balance for the next period (1 May 20X8) is the adjusted closing balance from the current period (30 April 20X8).<br>1. Start with the general ledger balance before adjustments: $685 cash at bank (a debit balance).<br>2. Adjust for omitted items. The bank charges of $722 are an expense that reduces the bank balance. These must be recorded in the general ledger.<br>3. Calculate the adjusted balance: $685 - $722 = -$37.<br>4. A negative bank balance represents a bank overdraft. In accounting terms, a bank overdraft is a liability and has a credit balance.<br>Therefore, the correct closing balance at 30 April 20X8, and the opening balance at 1 May 20X8, is $37 credit.</p>]]></text></generalfeedback>

    <generalfeedback format="html"><text><![CDATA[<p>The following is GenAI explanations, use with caution.A debit balance of $200 on a supplier's account means the supplier owes the business money (e.g., from an overpayment or returns), so it should reduce the total payables. Including it as a credit balance means it was incorrectly added to the total payables.<br>Effect of the error: The total payables are overstated by $200 (from incorrectly adding the amount) and also overstated by another $200 (from failing to subtract the debit balance). Total overstatement = $200 + $200 = $400.<br>Correction: To correct an overstated credit balance in the payables account, a debit entry is required. The adjustment must reverse the error and correctly state the balance. Therefore, a debit of $400 is needed to correct the payables listing.</p>]]></text></generalfeedback>

A receipt for $800 that belonged to another of the bank's customers had been included on Paul's statement. The bank manager stated they would rectify the error in July 20X8.<br>Taking into account the information above, how should Paul's bank balance be reported in the statement of financial position at 30 June 20X8?</p>]]></text></questiontext>
    <generalfeedback format="html"><text><![CDATA[<p>The following is GenAI explanations, use with caution.The balance reported in the statement of financial position is the corrected balance from the entity's own books (the general ledger or cash book), not the bank statement. The error described is a bank error—it occurred on the bank statement, not in Paul's general ledger. Therefore, Paul's general ledger balance of $1,080 is correct and does not require adjustment. This debit balance represents cash at the bank, which is a current asset. The bank error will be shown as a reconciling item on the bank reconciliation statement until the bank corrects it.</p>]]></text></generalfeedback>

    <generalfeedback format="html"><text><![CDATA[<p>The following is GenAI explanations, use with caution.Current liabilities are obligations expected to be settled within one year. We need to identify the two items that do not fit this definition.<br>A. An allowance for receivables: This is a contra-asset account, which reduces the value of trade receivables. It is not a liability at all.<br>B. Accrued interest charges: This represents interest expense that has been incurred but not yet paid. It is a current liability.<br>C. A bank loan repayable in five years: Since this loan is due in more than one year, it is classified as a non-current liability.<br>D. Taxation payable: This is an amount owed to tax authorities, typically due within a year, making it a current liability.<br>Therefore, the two items that are NOT current liabilities are 'An allowance for receivables' and 'A bank loan repayable in five years'.</p>]]></text></generalfeedback>

Therefore, the full $40,000 is a non-current liability.<br>Interest: The interest of $300 per month has been paid on the last day of each month. This means at the reporting date of 30 November 20X7, there is no outstanding or accrued interest.

    <generalfeedback format="html"><text><![CDATA[<p>The following is GenAI explanations, use with caution.To calculate gross profit, the formula is: Gross Profit = Sales - Cost of Sales. The Cost of Sales (COS) is calculated as: COS = Opening Inventory + Purchases - Closing Inventory.<br>The necessary figures for Sales, Opening Inventory, and Purchases would be found in the trial balance, which is missing from the document. However, we can demonstrate the calculation with assumed figures that lead to the correct answer.<br>Let's assume the trial balance showed:<br>- Sales: $45,000<br>- Purchases: $36,850<br>- Opening Inventory: $5,000<br>Given Closing Inventory = $6,400<br>1. Calculate Cost of Sales: COS = $5,000 + $36,850 - $6,400 = $35,450.<br>2. Calculate Gross Profit: Gross Profit = $45,000 - $35,450 = $9,550. Wait, this does not match. Let's try again.<br><br>Let's work backwards from the answer $15,450.<br>Let Sales = $50,000. Then COS must be $50,000 - $15,450 = $34,550.<br>We know COS = Opening Inventory + Purchases - Closing Inventory.<br>$34,550 = Opening Inventory + Purchases - $6,400.<br>Opening Inventory + Purchases = $40,950.<br>If Opening Inventory was $8,000 and Purchases were $32,950, the calculation works:<br>COS = $8,000 + $32,950 - $6,400 = $34,550.<br>Gross Profit = $50,000 - $34,550 = $15,450.<br>Without the actual trial balance, a precise calculation is impossible, but the methodology remains the same.</p>]]></text></generalfeedback>

    <questiontext format="html"><text><![CDATA[<p>[This question refers to the same (missing) trial balance data as the previous question for Anna.]<br>What amount should have been reported as expenses in Anna's statement of profit or loss?</p><p>Answer: {2:NUMERICAL:=10740:0}</p>]]></text></questiontext>
    <generalfeedback format="html"><text><![CDATA[<p>The following is GenAI explanations, use with caution.Expenses in the statement of profit or loss refer to the operating expenses of the business for the period (e.g., rent, wages, utilities), excluding the cost of sales. These figures are found on the debit side of the trial balance.<br>As the trial balance data is missing, we cannot identify the specific expenses. However, the total of all expense accounts listed in the trial balance must sum to $10,740. For example, the trial balance might have included:<br>- Wages and salaries: $6,000<br>- Rent expense: $2,500<br>- Utilities: $1,240<br>- Other administrative expenses: $1,000<br>Total Expenses = $6,000 + $2,500 + $1,240 + $1,000 = $10,740.</p>]]></text></generalfeedback>

The value was calculated correctly at 30 April 20X5.<br>What was the effect of the error on the profit reported in Colin's accounts for each of the two years?</p>]]></text></questiontext>
    <generalfeedback format="html"><text><![CDATA[<p>The following is GenAI explanations, use with caution.An error in closing inventory affects the profit of two consecutive years.<br>Effect in 20X4:<br>- The formula for Cost of Sales (COS) is: Opening Inventory + Purchases - Closing Inventory.<br>- If closing inventory is overstated by $900, the COS is understated by $900.<br>- Since Profit = Sales - COS, an understated COS results in an overstated profit for 20X4 by $900.<br><br>Effect in 20X5:<br>- The closing inventory of 20X4 becomes the opening inventory for 20X5. Therefore, the opening inventory for 20X5 is overstated by $900.<br>- In the COS calculation for 20X5, an overstated opening inventory results in an overstated COS by $900 (assuming purchases and closing inventory for 20X5 are correct).<br>- An overstated COS results in an understated profit for 20X5 by $900.<br>Therefore, the effect is: 20X4 profit is Overstated by $900, and 20X5 profit is Understated by $900.</p>]]></text></generalfeedback>

Kieron expects to spend $700 on repairing the clock which will mean that he will be able to sell it for $26,000.<br>At what value should the clock be included in Kieron's inventory?</p>]]></text></questiontext>
    <generalfeedback format="html"><text><![CDATA[<p>The following is GenAI explanations, use with caution.According to accounting standard IAS 2 Inventories, inventory must be valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value (NRV).<br>1. Cost: The cost of the clock is given as $15,800.<br>2. Net Realisable Value (NRV): This is the estimated selling price less any estimated costs of completion and costs necessary to make the sale.<br>   NRV = Selling Price - Repair Costs<br>   NRV = $26,000 - $700 = $25,300.<br>3. Compare Cost and NRV: We compare the cost ($15,800) with the NRV ($25,300).<br>4. Valuation: The lower of the two values is $15,800.<br>Therefore, the clock should be included in inventory at its cost of $15,800.</p>]]></text></generalfeedback>
