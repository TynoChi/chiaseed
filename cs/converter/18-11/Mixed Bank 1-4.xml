    <questiontext format="html"><text><![CDATA[<p>Jane is preparing her bank reconciliation. The bank balance in her general ledger is $422 credit. The only items which need to be dealt with are:<br>(i) A bank payment for $822 issued to a supplier which has not yet appeared on the bank statement.<br>(ii) Interest received of $153 which was credited by the bank, but not recorded by Jane.<br><br>What is the closing balance on Jane's bank statement?</p>]]></text></questiontext>
    <generalfeedback format="html"><text><![CDATA[<p>The ledger balance of $422 credit should be adjusted by a debit entry of $153 for interest. Thus, the corrected balance is $269 credit.<br>The statement balance will therefore be an overdraft of $269 after the bank payment of $822 has been processed.<br>Therefore the statement balance must currently be $553 cash at bank.</p>]]></text></generalfeedback>

Revenue for the year totalled $25,730. Harminder makes a mark-up of 25% on cost of all shoes he sells.<br><br>What was the cost of Harminder's purchases during the year?</p>]]></text></questiontext>
    <generalfeedback format="html"><text><![CDATA[<p>The first stage is to calculate the cost of sales. The gross profit is 20% (25/125) which is $5,146 (20% x $25,730). Cost of sales is therefore $25,730 – $5,146 = $20,584. The second stage is to calculate purchases by rearranging the cost of sales formula (opening inventory + purchases – closing inventory = cost of sales). Hence, purchases are $20,584 + $1,570 – $2,050 = $20,104.</p>]]></text></generalfeedback>

    <questiontext format="html"><text><![CDATA[<p>Richard compared his bank statement with the bank account in his general ledger and found that they did not agree. He investigated further and concluded that there were two possible reasons for the discrepancy.<br>(i) A cheque from one of his customers was returned by the bank as unpaid. The customer has since filed for bankruptcy.<br>(ii) The bank charged him for going overdrawn for one day in the period.<br><br>Which of the reasons require an entry in the bank account in Richard's general ledger?</p>]]></text></questiontext>
    <generalfeedback format="html"><text><![CDATA[<p>Both reasons will require Richard to make an entry in his general ledger. Lodgements from customers would already have been reflected in the general ledger, but the cheque which bounced would not have. Similarly, bank charges made by the bank would not have been reflected in the general ledger – they would only appear on Richard's bank statement, so need to be included in the general ledger.</p>]]></text></generalfeedback>

    <questiontext format="html"><text><![CDATA[<p>Jamie bought a new mowing machine for his gardening business on 1 January 20X3 for $2,380. He had to pay $120 for the machine to be delivered to him. At the time of purchase, he also paid $300 insurance for the machine in the event of malfunction or theft. Jamie charges depreciation at 10% per year on the straight-line basis, with a full year's charge in the year of acquisition and none in the year of disposal.<br><br>What will be the carrying amount of the mowing machine at the 31 December 20X4?</p><p>Answer: {1:NUMERICAL:=2000:0}</p>]]></text></questiontext>
    <generalfeedback format="html"><text><![CDATA[<p>According to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment, the costs to be included are those incurred in bringing the asset to working condition for its intended use. So in this case, the transportation costs of $120 will be capitalised along with the $2,380 purchase price. The insurance costs cannot be included and will be charged to the statement of profit or loss. The total capitalised cost is therefore $2,500. The depreciation charge each year will be 10% of this ie $250. So the closing carrying amount at 31 December 20X4 will be $2,000 ($2,500 – ($250 × 2 years)).</p>]]></text></generalfeedback>
