    <generalfeedback format="html"><text><![CDATA[<p>The following is GenAI explanations, use with caution.The total outstanding loan at 31 May 20X5 is $27,000. Liabilities are split between current (payable within 12 months) and non-current (payable after 12 months). The loan is repaid in six-monthly instalments of $3,000. In the next 12 months from 31 May 20X5, two instalments will be due (on 1 November 20X5 and 1 May 20X6).<br>Current liability = 2 x $3,000 = $6,000.<br>Non-current liability = Total outstanding balance - Current liability = $27,000 - $6,000 = $21,000.<br>Therefore, the correct reporting is a current liability of $6,000 and a non-current liability of $21,000.</p>]]></text></generalfeedback>

    <generalfeedback format="html"><text><![CDATA[<p>The following is GenAI explanations, use with caution.First, calculate the required allowance at the year-end (31 October 20X5).<br>Required allowance = 2% of $275,600 = $5,512.<br>Next, compare the required allowance with the opening allowance (at 1 November 20X4), which was $5,670.<br>The allowance has decreased from $5,670 to $5,512. The change is $5,670 - $5,512 = $158.<br>A decrease in the allowance for receivables is treated as income and is therefore a credit to the statement of profit or loss.</p>]]></text></generalfeedback>

    <generalfeedback format="html"><text><![CDATA[<p>The following is GenAI explanations, use with caution.The unrecorded advertising expense of $250 needs to be accounted for. This increases total expenses, which in turn reduces the profit for the year.<br>Revised Profit = Original Profit - Unrecorded Expense = $24,952 - $250 = $24,702.<br>The closing capital is calculated as Opening Capital + Profit - Drawings. Since the profit is reduced by $250, the closing capital will also be reduced by the same amount.<br>Revised Capital = Original Capital - Reduction in Profit = $75,841 - $250 = $75,591.</p>]]></text></generalfeedback>

The assistant incorrectly treated it as capital expenditure (an asset).<br>Effect on Profit: By not recording the $2,500 repair expense, the total expenses are understated. Understated expenses lead to an overstatement of profit.<br>Effect on Assets: By incorrectly capitalizing the repair cost, the value of assets on the statement of financial position is increased by $2,500. This means the assets are overstated.<br>Therefore, both profit and assets are overstated.</p>]]></text></generalfeedback>

    <questiontext format="html"><text><![CDATA[<p>In Tina's statement of profit or loss for the year ended 31 May 20X6 the charge for motor repairs was $2,850. This included an accrual of $220.<br><br>When Tina's opening trial balance at 1 June 20X6 is prepared, what will be the correct balance on the motor repairs account?</p>]]></text></questiontext>
    <generalfeedback format="html"><text><![CDATA[<p>The following is GenAI explanations, use with caution.At the year-end (31 May 20X6), the motor repairs expense account, with its total balance of $2,850, is closed off to the statement of profit or loss. This leaves the motor repairs expense account with a zero balance. The accrual of $220 is recorded as a liability (Cr Accruals) and is carried forward to the next period. In the new period starting 1 June 20X6, this accrual is often reversed. The reversing journal entry would be Dr Accruals $220 and Cr Motor Repairs $220. This puts an initial credit balance on the motor repairs account for the new year, against which actual payments will be debited. Therefore, the opening balance effect on the motor repairs account is a $220 credit.</p>]]></text></generalfeedback>

    <generalfeedback format="html"><text><![CDATA[<p>The following is GenAI explanations, use with caution.The statement of financial position columns must balance. The basic accounting equation is Assets = Liabilities + Equity. In the proforma, this translates to Debits (Assets) = Credits (Liabilities + Opening Capital +/- Profit/Loss).

A debit entry to the equity section signifies a reduction in capital, which is caused by a loss.<br>A loss occurs when expenses (P&L debits) are greater than income (P&L credits).
