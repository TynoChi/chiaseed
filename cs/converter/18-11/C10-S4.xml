    <questiontext format="html"><text><![CDATA[<p>Larry, a sole trader, has calculated that his cost of sales for the year is $144,000. His sales figure for the year includes an amount of $2,016 being the amount paid by Larry himself into the business bank account for goods withdrawn for private use.<br>The figure of $2,016 was calculated by adding a mark-up of 12% to the cost of the goods. His gross profit percentage on all other goods sold was 20% of sales.<br><br>What is the total figure of sales for the year?</p>]]></text></questiontext>
    <generalfeedback format="html"><text><![CDATA[<p>The following is GenAI explanations, use with caution.This question requires calculating the total sales by separating the goods sold to customers from the goods withdrawn by the owner.<br><br>1.  **Calculate the cost of goods withdrawn:**<br>The value of goods withdrawn ($2,016) includes a 12% mark-up on their cost.<br>Sales Value = Cost × (1 + Mark-up %)<br>$2,016 = Cost × (1 + 0.12)<br>$2,016 = Cost × 1.12<br>Cost of withdrawn goods = $2,016 / 1.12 = $1,800.<br><br>2.  **Calculate the cost of goods sold to external customers:**<br>The total cost of sales includes both goods sold and goods withdrawn.<br>Cost of sales to customers = Total cost of sales - Cost of withdrawn goods<br>Cost of sales to customers = $144,000 - $1,800 = $142,200.<br><br>3.  **Calculate the sales revenue from external customers:**<br>The gross profit percentage (margin) on these sales is 20%. This means the cost of sales represents 80% (100% - 20%) of the sales value.<br>Sales to customers = Cost of sales to customers / (1 - Gross Profit Margin)<br>Sales to customers = $142,200 / 0.80 = $177,750.<br><br>4.  **Calculate the total figure for sales:**<br>The total sales figure is the sum of sales to customers and the value of goods withdrawn.<br>Total Sales = Sales to customers + Value of goods withdrawn<br>Total Sales = $177,750 + $2,016 = $179,766.<br><br>Therefore, the total figure for sales for the year is $179,766.</p>]]></text></generalfeedback>

    <generalfeedback format="html"><text><![CDATA[<p>The following is GenAI explanations, use with caution.Closing capital is calculated using the accounting equation: Capital = Assets - Liabilities. We need to calculate the total assets and total liabilities, including the adjustment for the omitted invoice.<br><br>1.  **Calculate Total Assets:**<br>Assets are the economic resources owned by the business.<br>Total Assets = Non-current assets + Inventory + Receivables<br>Total Assets = $41,700 + $9,860 + $7,695 = $59,255<br><br>2.  **Calculate Adjusted Total Liabilities:**<br>Liabilities are the obligations of the business. Initially, the liabilities are Payables and Bank overdraft. The unpaid invoice of $258 is an additional liability (an accrual) that must be included.<br>Initial Liabilities = Payables + Bank overdraft<br>Initial Liabilities = $4,174 + $5,537 = $9,711<br>Adjusted Total Liabilities = Initial Liabilities + Unpaid invoice<br>Adjusted Total Liabilities = $9,711 + $258 = $9,969<br><br>3.  **Calculate Closing Capital:**<br>Closing Capital = Total Assets - Adjusted Total Liabilities<br>Closing Capital = $59,255 - $9,969 = $49,286<br><br>Therefore, the correct value of Albert's closing capital is $49,286.</p>]]></text></generalfeedback>

    <generalfeedback format="html"><text><![CDATA[<p>The following is GenAI explanations, use with caution.To find the sales revenue, we first need to calculate the cost of sales (COS).<br><br>1.  **Calculate Cost of Sales (COS):**<br>The formula for cost of sales is:<br>COS = Opening Inventory + Purchases – Closing Inventory<br>COS = $386,200 + $989,000 – $422,700<br>COS = $1,375,200 – $422,700<br>COS = $952,500<br><br>2.  **Calculate Sales Revenue:**<br>The gross profit is 40% of sales. This is the gross profit margin. This means the cost of sales must be the remaining percentage of sales.<br>Cost of Sales % = 100% – Gross Profit %<br>Cost of Sales % = 100% – 40% = 60%<br><br>So, $952,500 represents 60% of the total sales revenue.<br>Sales Revenue = Cost of Sales / 60%<br>Sales Revenue = $952,500 / 0.60<br>Sales Revenue = $1,587,500<br><br>The sales revenue for the year is $1,587,500.</p>]]></text></generalfeedback>

    <questiontext format="html"><text><![CDATA[<p>Which of the following calculations could produce an acceptable figure for a sole trader's profit for the year for a period if no accounting records had been kept?</p>]]></text></questiontext>
    <generalfeedback format="html"><text><![CDATA[<p>The following is GenAI explanations, use with caution.This question relates to the accounting equation for changes in capital (net assets) over a period for a sole trader. The fundamental formula is:<br><br>Closing net assets = Opening net assets + Capital introduced + Profit for the year – Drawings<br><br>To find the profit for the year when other figures are known (a method often used with incomplete records), we need to rearrange this formula to make 'Profit for the year' the subject.<br><br>1.  Start with the base formula:<br>Closing net assets = Opening net assets + Capital introduced + Profit – Drawings<br><br>2.  Isolate Profit by moving all other terms to the other side of the equation:<br>Profit = Closing net assets – Opening net assets – Capital introduced + Drawings<br><br>3.  Reordering the terms to match the options given:<br>Profit = Closing net assets + drawings – capital introduced – opening net assets<br><br>This matches the first option exactly.<br>Let's check the other options:<br>- Option B incorrectly adds capital and subtracts drawings.<br>- Option C incorrectly subtracts both capital and drawings.<br>- Option D incorrectly adds both capital and drawings.</p>]]></text></generalfeedback>

    <questiontext format="html"><text><![CDATA[<p>A business has opening inventory $30,000, achieves a mark-up of 25% on sales, sales totalled $1,000,000, purchases were $840,000. Calculate closing inventory.</p>]]></text></questiontext>
    <generalfeedback format="html"><text><![CDATA[<p>The following is GenAI explanations, use with caution.This question requires calculating the closing inventory by first determining the cost of sales.<br><br>The phrase 'mark-up of 25% on sales' is ambiguous. A 'mark-up' is typically calculated on cost, while a percentage 'on sales' is called a 'margin'. However, if we interpret it as a standard mark-up on cost, we can find the cost of sales (COS) and then the closing inventory.<br><br>1.  **Calculate Cost of Sales (COS) assuming a 25% mark-up on cost:**<br>Sales = Cost of Sales × (1 + Mark-up %)<br>$1,000,000 = COS × (1 + 0.25)<br>$1,000,000 = COS × 1.25<br>COS = $1,000,000 / 1.25<br>COS = $800,000<br><br>2.  **Calculate Closing Inventory:**<br>The formula for cost of sales is:<br>COS = Opening Inventory + Purchases – Closing Inventory<br>We can rearrange this to solve for Closing Inventory:<br>Closing Inventory = Opening Inventory + Purchases – COS<br>Closing Inventory = $30,000 + $840,000 – $800,000<br>Closing Inventory = $870,000 – $800,000<br>Closing Inventory = $70,000<br><br>This calculation leads to one of the given options and is the standard interpretation in the absence of clarity.</p>]]></text></generalfeedback>
