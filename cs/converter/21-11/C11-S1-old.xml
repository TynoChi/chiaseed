    <generalfeedback format="html"><text><![CDATA[<p>No explanation provided in the source.<br>The following is GenAI explanations, use with caution.<br>Partnership agreements typically cover the division of profits, interest on capital/drawings, and salaries. While loans can be mentioned, setting a strict 'maximum amount' for loans is not a standard or necessary clause compared to the others, as loans are often handled on a case-by-case basis as advances.</p>]]></text></generalfeedback>
